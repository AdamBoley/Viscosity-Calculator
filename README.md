# Background

By training and profession, I am a chemist. I have a first-class honours degree in chemistry and have worked in laboratories for all of my career. My current position is with Intertek, testing all manner of petrochemical products - lubricating oils, additives and crude oils. 

My informal specialty within my team is in the analysis of viscosity, and I do the vast majority of viscosity tests that we are contracted to perform. 

Broadly speaking, viscosity is a measurement of how well a fluid material resists flow - a higher viscosity means that the fluid has a greater resistance to flow, and a lower viscosity means that the fluid has a lesser resistance to flow. Honey, for example, is a fluid of relatively high viscosity, whereas water is a fluid of very low viscosity. 

Viscosity isn't a loose definition - it can be measured with great accuracy in laboratories by several different means, and at different temperatures. The most common measurement that I do in my profession life is that of kinematic viscosity. In commercial laboratories, the procedures for the making of measurements are laid down in industry standard test methods written, published and reviewed by standards organisations. In my line of work, two of the best-regarded such organisations are the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Institute of Petroleum (IP). Both organisations publish standard test methods for the measurement of kinematic viscosity. These are the ASTM D445 and the IP 71 methods, though both are functionally equivalent. 

Both of these methods state that kinematic viscosity is to be measured by a means of a glass instrument called a viscometer, and several different designs are available based on particular requirements, though the most common are the Ubbelohde type and the Zeitfuchs cross-arm type. The Ubbelohde type consists of a reservoir that holds the fluid, a bulb with timing marks and a capillary (a thin tube, essentially) through which the fluid flows. By means of a vacuum, the fluid is drawn from the reservoir through the capillary and into the bulb. When the vacuum is released, the fluid begins to drain back down through the capillary. When the fluid front drains past the first timing mark, a stop-watch or timer is started, and when the fluid front drains past the second timing mark, the timer is stopped. 

The Zeitfuchs cross-arm type consists of the same features, except that the reservoir sits above the bulb, and the fluid is drawn forwards by vacuum through the capillary. When the fluid passes the first timing mark, a timer is started and when the fluid passes the second mark, it is stopped. Whereas a fluid in the Ubbelohde type can be tested repeatedly, the Zeitfuchs type is a 'one-shot' viscometer, though this makes it useful for extremely dark fluids that would obscure the timing marks on an Ubbelohde viscometer. 

Both type of viscometer produce a time when used to test the fluid. This time is multiplied by a constant that is unique to each viscometer, and this produces a kinematic viscosity value. However, one kinematic viscosity isn't sufficient, and both of the above methods specify that two such measurements must be made. These two measurements are then averaged. 

At this point, you may be wondering as to the purpose of this project - multiplication and averaging are simple mathematical operations that don't require an entire website to do, surely? A pocket calculator could be used. 

This is indeed true. However, the methods specify thatgit add .
