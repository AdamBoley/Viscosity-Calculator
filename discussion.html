            <h2>Using the Viscosity Calculator</h2>
            <p>The Viscosity Calculator automates the calculations specified in ASTM D445, the standard test method for the determination of kinematic viscosity. The latest version of D445 is D445-21. </p>
            <p>Using this tool is straightforward. Follow the steps below:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Firstly, select the calculation you want to perform from the drop-down menu. The tool defaults to the calculation of determinability.</li>
                <li>Next, enter all of the required data in the white input fields.</li>
                <li>Then, press "calculate".</li>
                <li>
                    The tool will then perform all of the calculations and display the outputs. 
                    For all calculations except the viscometer recalibration calculation, a final output indicates whether your data meets the criteria. 
                    For the recalibration calculation, the final output will be the new viscometer constant.
                </li>
                <li>To use the tool again, click the reset button to empty the input and output fields.</li>
            </ol>
        </article>

            <h2>Selecting the correct calculation option</h2>
            <p>The tool contains 5 calculations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Determinability</li>

            <p>Selecting the correct option is essential. See below for a short discussion on when the use each calculation:</p>

                <h3 id="terms">A note on terminology</h3>
                <p>
                    We scientists are prone to using obscure terminology, so this section serves as a guide to what we're talking about when we use certain terms
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Run-time</em>, <em>drop-time</em> or <em>determination</em>: 
                    a time measured in seconds between when the fluid front in a viscometer passes the first timing mark to when it passes the second timing mark
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Determined kinematic viscosity</em>:
                    a viscosity value that is calculated by multiplying a single run-time with the constant of the viscometer used to obtain the run-time
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Final calculated kinematic viscosity</em> or <em>final average viscosity</em>:
                    a viscosity value obtained by averaging two determined kinematic viscosities that are sufficiently close enough to valid, as defined by the determinability calculation
                </p>
            
            <h3 id="determinability">Determinability</h3>
            <p>
                Determinability is the calculation performed on two determined kinematic viscosities. 
                The determinability calculation checks whether the two viscosities are close enough that they are valid and can be used to calculate the final calculated kinematic viscosity. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Viscosity Calculator only requires the two run-times you have made, and the constant of the viscometer used. 
                If you used two Zeitfuchs cross-arm viscometers, enter both constants, matching each constant to the corresponding run-time. 
            </p>

            <h3 id="repeatability">Repeatability</h3>
            <p>
                Repeatability is the calculation performed on two final calculated kinematic viscosities that have been calculated for the same sample in the same laboratory by the same operator.
                The repeatability calculation is typically done when a client wishes the laboratory to perform a second analysis on a sample to check that the first analysis was accurate.
                The repeatability calculation checks that the two final calculated kinematic viscosities are close enough that the second result confirms the accuracy of the first result.   
            </p>
            
            <h3 id="reproducibility">Reproducibility</h3>
            <p>
                Reproducibility is similar to repeatability, except that the reproducibility calculation is performed on two final calculated kinematic viscosities that have each been obtained from 
                a different laboratory. Reproducibility is typically used when a client sends the same sample to two or more laboratories and wishes to compare their results, 
                or when a standards organisation such as the International Standards Organisation (ISO) or ASTM 
                conducts a 'round robin' study to ensure that laboratories are operating to the same standards. 
            </p>
            
            <h3 id="calibration">Calibration</h3>
            <p>
                The calibration calculation is used when a laboratory wishes to check that a viscometer can still be relied on to give the same results year after year.
                Calibrations are also conducted when a viscometer has been repaired or otherwise returned to service, to check that it will still give accurate results. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Calibrations are conducted using calibration fluids, which are specialised petroleum products whose viscosity is exactly known at a range of temperatures. 
                If the final calculated kinematic viscosity obtained from a calibration test matches the known viscosity of the calibration fluid at the temperature at which the test was 
                conducted, to within a certain percentage difference, then the viscometer has been successfully calibrated, and may then be confidently used by the laboratory to 
                test samples.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The Viscosity Calculator requires only the two run-times obtained from the calibration test, the constant of the viscometer used and the known viscosity of the 
                calibration fluid at the temperature at which the calibration test was conducted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For reference, the table below shows the tolerance for each range of calibration fluid viscosities:
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Viscosity of calibration fluid</th>
                    <th>Tolerance band</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>10 - 100 cSt</td>
                    <td>+/- 0.32%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>100 - 1,000 cSt</td>
                    <td>+/- 0.36%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1,000 - 10,000 cSt</td>
                    <td>+/- 0.42%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>10,000 - 100,000 cSt</td>
                    <td>+/- 0.54%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Greater than 100,000 cSt</td>
                    <td>+/- 0.73%</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                The percentage difference may also be manually calculated using the equation below:
            </p>
            <p>
                ((calculated viscosity - calibration fluid viscosity) / (average of calculated viscosity and calibration fluid viscosity)) x 100
            </p>
            
            <h3 id="recalibration">Recalibration</h3>
            <p>
                It may suprise you to learn that Earth's gravity is not constant across its surface. Gravity varies from 9.78 m/s<span class="superscript">2</span> to 9.83 m/s<span class="superscript">2</span> 
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that falling objects will have a very slighly different acceleration due to gravity, depending on where they are dropped on Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                This also applies to kinematic viscosity tests, as the fluids within viscometers flow under gravity. The variance of gravity is slight, but given the precision with which 
                viscometer constants are determined by standardisation laboratories, there is a mechanism by which a viscometer may be recalibrated and assigned a different constant. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The recalibration calculation requires the constant of the viscometer undergoing recalibration and two values of gravity - the first being the gravity at your laboratory's 
                location and the second being the gravity at the standardisation laboratory's location. The tool will calculate the percentage difference between the two gravity values, 
                and, if it is greater than 0.1%, will produce a new constant for the viscometer. If the percentage difference is less than 0.1%, the tool will inform you of this and stop, 
                since D445 specifies that a percentage difference of less than 0.1% means that recalibration is unnecessary.

        <article id="sample">
            <h2>Selecting the correct sample type</h2>

            <p>
                Selecting the correct option from the drop-down menus of the determinability, repeatability and reproducibility calculations is important. 
                Each option applies vastly different equations in the calculations, so selecting the wrong sample type could mean the difference between your results passing and failing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, the sample types are distinct, and can be easily told apart. See below for a discussion on the typical characteristics of each sample type. 
            </p>

            <h3 id="base-oils">Base Oils</h3>
            <p>
                Base oils, also called base stocks, are the majority component of lubricating oils, usually making up between 90% and 95% by volume.
            </p>
            <p>
                Base Oils are almost universally clear and colourless. If analysed using the D1500 Colour of Petroleum Products method, they would rate either 0.5 or less.
            </p>
            <p>
                Base oils tend to have a fairly low viscosity, usually around 20cSt at 40C and 4cSt at 100C. 
            </p>

            <h3 id="formulated-oils">Formulated Oils</h3>
            <p>
                Formulated Oils, also known as lubricating oils, are produced by combining base oils with various additives (see below). Formulated oils are most often used as 
                engine oils and gear oils in combustion engine vehicles. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on the intended purpose of the formulated oil, the oil will have a higher or lower dosage of additives, which affects its viscosity and colour. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Oils with lower additive dosages are less viscous, and typically possess a golden, yellow or light orange colour, and are clear. 
                Oils with higher additive dosages a more viscous, and typically possess a dark orange or brown colour. 
                If analysed using the D1500 method, formulated oils typically rate between 1 and 5. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Formulated oils typically have a higher viscosity than base oils, usually around 30cSt at 40C and 7cSt at 100C
            </p>
            <p>
                The repeatability and reproducibility functions of the Viscosity Calculator also have the option of selecting Used Motor Oils. 
                These are formulated oils that have either undergone some sort of laboratory test, or have actually been used in an engine. 
                Used motor oils have typically have been subjected to heating and/or oxidation. This often makes them darker in colour and more viscous. 
                Used motor oils may reach as high as 60cSt at 40C and 15cSt at 100C. 
            </p>
            
            <h3 id="additives">Additives</h3>
            <p>
                Additives are the component of formulated oils that gives them the properties that make them useful for automotive applications. 
                Additives allow formulated oils to keep engines clean, respond well to high temperatures and can help protect the engine from the acidic byproducts of combustion. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additives are typically very dark and very viscous. If analysed by the D1500 Colour of Petroleum Products method, additives typically rate between 7 and 8, or even higher. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At 40C, additives typically have a viscosity of between 1500 and 3000cSt, and at 100C a viscosity of between 100 and 250cSt. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additives are chemically complex, and so can suffer from shear effects - that is, the additive can have its viscosity change as it is heated and tested.
                In these cases, the Viscosity Calculator will likely always give failure results.
            </p>

            <h3 id="crude-oils">Crude Oils and residues</h3>
            <p>
                Crude Oils are the unrefined product of drilling operations. Samples of crude oils received for laboratory analysis are identical to the material that is extracted
                from oil fields. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Crude oils are almost always black in colour, but due to the conditions of oil reservoirs around the world, crude oils can have considerable variance in viscosity. 
                Crude oils also contain a huge range of hydrocarbons, from very short chain molecules such as ethane and propane, to much longer-chain molecules that are used in the 
                production of asphalt and bitumen. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The short-chain molecules present in crude oil often come out of solution when a vacuum is used to draw the sample into a viscometer's bulb, so it is often the case that 
                sucessive run-time determinations will show increases in run-time, since the short-chain molecules are removed and the propotion of longer-chain molecules increases, which 
                increases viscosity. 
            </p>
            <p>
                That said, this shouldn't cause the Viscosity Calculator calculations to fail, since the limits for crude oils are quite large. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Residues are the product of refining crude oils, and are composed of the heavier, longer-chain fractions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since residues are the product of fractional distillation, which requires extreme heating, they are devoid of volatile molecules. 
                This makes them very stable at high temperatures, and it is frequently very easy to get results that are determinable, repeatable and reproducible.
                The main difficulty comes from handling them, as they can be sticky. 
            </p>

            <h3 id="residual-fuel-oils">Residual fuel oils</h3>
            <p>
                Residual Fuel Oils are essentially crude oils with the lighter fractions removed. As a result, they tend to be very dark or black in colour. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Residual fuel oils at 100C share the same determinability equation as crude oils and residues, and at 50C require only a very slightly tigher equation. This 
                frequently makes it easy to get determinable results. The equations for repeatability and reproducibility produce almost absurdly large tolerance bands, so there 
                is often little difficulty in acquiring valid results.  
            </p>

            <h3 id="petroleum-wax">Petroleum Wax</h3>
            <p>
                Petroleum waxes are solid at room temperature, but are nonethless soft and malleable. They usually have a white or bluish-white colour.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once melted, petroleum waxes tend to have a low viscosity, typically between 3cSt and 16cSt at 100C. 
            </p>

            <h3 id="gas-oils">Gas Oils</h3>
            <p>
                Gas oils tend to have a fairly low viscosity, usually having a viscosity of around 10cSt at 40C. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Gas Oils tend to have a pale yellow colour, and by D1500 would rate between 1 and 2. 
            </p>

            <h3>Kerosene, diesel and biodiesel</h3>
            <p>
                Kerosenes, diesels and biodisels have a very low viscosity, usually having a viscosity of around 10cSt at 40C. These samples are clear and colourless.
